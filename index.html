                <p> Hi, there! I'm Chelsea. I'm currently a prosthetist/orthotist, and I work with kiddos who need my help to walk and move. 
                I am married to my favorite person in the world, and we have two giant dogs and a cat who thinks he is a dog. 
                We live in Colorado Springs, in our dream home in the mountains. I hope we never have to move. </p>
                <p>I'm a mountain biker and retired adventure racer. I have some crazy outdoor stories from my days of racing in the wilderness for days on end. They were good (and sometimes scary) times, but now I prefer the simplicity of days spent mountain biking or mountaineering with friends. It feeds my soul!</p>
                <p>For additional fun and skill-building, I work in a race car shop. I help the owner build his race projects, but I am also in the midst of converting my motorcycle to electric. I want my motorcycle to be my daily commuter and errand-runner vehicle. Fun stuff!</p>
                <p>Feel free to check out my <a class="intext" href="portfolio.html">projects</a> or drop me <a class="intext" href="contact.html">a line</a>!</p>
